Progress on Prototype halted due to node.js' incompatilibility with Audio functions. Will rewrite the entire prototype with html format. Work over the pass few days was slow due to installation issues of packages, etc.

Progress on the newprototype made. Ran into an issue with mp3 testfile not working in the live server extension in visual studio

Date 23/3/18
Research done on mp3 file. Discovered my linux machine cannot decode mp3 files.
Site used to test which audio file my VM will read: https://hpr.dogphilosophy.net/test/

Date 24/3/18
Further research on html5 limiting issues. Switching over to web audio api, as the audio function provided by html is muddled with mutliple issues and I do not completely understand the issues.

Tested a little on youtube links in using the html functions. Works smoothly, possibly the best solution to playing the recorded video and audio.
