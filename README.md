### Vision:
Inaugurated in 2005, the ANU School of Music's Keyboard Institute is the largest collection of freshly-built copies of historical instruments and period instruments in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the largest growing keyboard collection in Australia, and the largest public and scholarly resource of historical instruments in Australia.

The keyboard institute has their [own website](http://music.cass.anu.edu.au/services/instruments-equipment/keyboard-institute) hosted on the ANU School of Music's webpage, but are looking for a better way to promote the institute and what it has to offer. As such, we've been tasked with using technology to not only promote the institute, but allow users to interact and engage with the instruments in the collection. We aim to do this in two ways

-----

1. Create a new website for the keyboard institute.

The current website for the keyboard institute needs a bit of love. We would look to create a highly interactive, where users can experience high quality audio and video documentation of the instruments, information about the instruments (History, Description), and possibly interviews regarding the instruments.

-----

2. Investigate the possibility of using VR to allow users to more directly and immersively interact with the instruments.

We have brainstormed a couple potential ways to achieve this including recording sample libraries to allow users to "play" the instruments via MIDI instruments, 3D modelling some of the instruments and allowing users to view the features in 3D space, and creating a 3D 'tour' of the institute allowing people to move as they please. This part of the project is really a stretch goal, and will be further explored later in the course.

### Stakeholders:
An updated stakeholder analysis document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Ul3rSgEJSUHEyfhIMToEOukqs50d71MPK-DREw6D3w/edit?usp=sharing). 

----

### Stakeholder Expectations:
The clients have expressed that the expectation is for us to produce some sort of interactive experience promoting the instruments they have in the keyboard institute. How to do so has mostly been left in our own hands.

----

### Delivering Value:
Our main goal is to create an interactive website full of high fidelity images and sound, and information about the instruments itself. Our plan is to make use of the resources we have here at the ANU, including the recording studio, the cameras in the ANU School of Art, and the invaluable advice and assistance from the bright minds around the ANU. We will be looking to host this website on the ANU School of Music's domain if possible, and will hopefully draw more people to the institute to make use of the wide range of instruments available.

----

### Timeline:
|Week|Goal|
|---:|----|
|4|Ensure all planning is wrapped up and all aspects of the project are up and running.|
|8|First Deliverable: Early version of the website. This would include the general webpage structure and the instrument information.|
|10|Second Deliverable: A pre-release version of the website, possibly with some audio, video and sound.|
|12|Third Deliverable: Release the webpage.|

*Note:* This is a preliminary timeline for the project, and as such is subject to change.

----

### Constraints:
- We need to investigate whether or not we can get our website hosted on the ANU School of Music's domain, and how much we can put on the website (in terms of memory usage)

----

### Risks and Costs:
- Potential web hosting costs
- If we choose to develop with Unity later in the project, may look to host with Unity's version control system, which may possibly incur costs.

----

### Management:
**Project Repository:** You're on it! GitHub will be used to host our project code. We plan to make use of the issues system when development begins.

**Trello :** [Email Lachlan for access.](u5826298@anu.edu.au) Trello will be used to help plan our project.

**File Repository** [Email Lachlan for access.](u5826298@anu.edu.au). We are using Google Drive to host our miscellaneous  files, including meeting minutes and design documents.

### Lachlan
My main tasks over the last few weeks have been the design and creation of the website and having a closer look into who our stakeholders are. I sketched up a preliminary website layout which can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aujMO9EwR0AfPPeKrYTFQHl4Qn4CXKtW/view?usp=sharing), drawing inspiration from other collection websites such as the National Museum of Australia's website or the Cobbe Collection's website. Links to the websites can be [found in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HSZcu49xulXLYukwxN2Cho2JdxEBDAAzwIgKhEQ1QPI/edit?usp=sharing). I also began the creation of the website, which I have been writing in HTML and CSS. My progress can be found [on the HTML branch of the main repository](https://github.com/LachyStevens/keyboard-institute/tree/HTML).

I decided that it would be useful for us to better understand who our stakeholders are and how they will interact with the project, so I took the time to write up a more in-depth [stakeholder analysis document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Ul3rSgEJSUHEyfhIMToEOukqs50d71MPK-DREw6D3w/edit?usp=sharing). The hope is that it will guide our design process by reminding us who will be using the website and why they will use the website, allowing us to design with the goal of satisfying their needs.

On top of that, I scheduled and ran team meetings, which involved writing up a meeting agenda, convening the meeting, and taking meeting minutes, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bCDOd2gmwWWTcR9eA4sqHAINEFRGkQLb?usp=sharing).

### Frank
Over the past few weeks, I have been working on the prototype of our interactive showcase. Briefly, I used the p5.js library to implement basic function such as interacting with an image with mouse and advanced functionality such as animating Isolated key and producing sound. The process went smooth, and now the prototype is tested successfully. In future, I could add more features and visual effects to it if necessary . My work can be found [here](https://github.com/TheOneFrank/keyboard-institute). A video example of it working can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4nGT9bbIlgDRluwQuz9GfreupyHv8ZY/view?usp=sharing).

### Ben
Ben's has been handling a majority of the communication with other parties over the past few weeks. He has met with photographers (Katharine, Sophie) to talk about their availibility to come and photograph the pianos, JP from the School of Art about hiring photography and video recording gear, Matt and Craig G from the School of Music about studio availibility, Craig E from the School of Music Administration about web hosting, and met with Mike to discuss his availability for recording. A log of his correspondences can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1blx8DlmqbK3TJE9J5ySXMaY4hD-XndhD8AncnoUOY20/edit?usp=sharing), and contact details for these parties can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k8iA3GZwxqPG9Qqy8-KB6A4M8CoCCXzKTnyzBaALQ5Y/edit?usp=sharing).

### Joshua
Over the past two weeks, I have been researching and testing the audio functions that have been provided by well known and commonly used website languages. While I had initially stated my goal to prototype a website with working audio and a slideshow, the former took too much time debugging for work to begin on the latter. This also led into research on possible ways to host audio and video links on the website. Further progress notes on code work audio functions have been documented in the progress.md document in the github repo. All work has been committed to a [forked github repo](https://github.com/Joshua-Liow/keyboard-institute), which has also been pushed to the provided audit page. Any sites visited during research have been documented in a separate [Google drive document](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vdxhKn5fEPqsoiDDeDTPdP3MXn4-Fm1b).

---

### Seng
For the last few weeks I have been working on the design of the website. I used Microsoft PowerPoint to prototype by creating slideshows that not only look like a website but also can somewhat simulate user interaction. These prototypes showed my design of the virtual tour and the website in general.

The latest version can be found [here](https://goo.gl/cdMZSw).

### The Next Few Weeks...
We are looking to begin recording in the second week of the midsemester break. The plan so far is to document three pianos in three days, with possibly a fourth day in case we don't get everything done. We are planning to split the day into halves, one half for sound recording and the other for photography/video recording. Apart from that, we will continue having regular weekly meetings and keep up our progress on the technical aspects of this project. As per our timeline as stated above, we would love to have an early version of the website done by week 8, so we are aiming to get to a stage where we have preliminary photos and interactivity so that when we do get our multimedia resources, we can put them straight in. Currently we are on track to reach our week 8 goals.

### Lachlan
My role since the last audit has been lead web developer. Since audit 2, I have gone through many website layout iterations, each on its own branch in the [main repository](https://github.com/LachyStevens/keyboard-institute). Many of these iterations were created in the ANU recording studio, as I attended 3 of the 4 total days we had scheduled. The other time spent in the studio was helping Ben with anything I could, as truth be told I was slightly out of my depth. I organised getting temporary web hosting until we get a response from the ANU about hosting on their domain. As such, the website is now being hosted at [historicalkeyboardinstitute.com](historicalkeyboardinstitute.com). The website currently being hosted is the earliest iteration of our combined efforts. To make this happen, I had to coordinate with Frank and Joshua to get the interactive javascript and hosted audio respectively running on the website. Finally, I set up and took minutes for our meetings. This involved me writing meeting agendas, reminding everyone of when our meetings were scheduled, and ensuring the schedules ran smoothly. The meeting minutes can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bCDOd2gmwWWTcR9eA4sqHAINEFRGkQLb). I also reminded people to make use of our [trello board](https://trello.com/b/A9V5J7d7/keyboard-institute).

### Frank
In the past several days, I have accomplished the version 2 of virtual tour. Adding two more scenes (hammer and cap off), optimising the transition effect, adding pseudo text along with each scene, and adding a magnifier effect. Within this development period, the desired outcome is so much harder than I thought initially, and I found that visual effects will be limited and time consuming if hard coding with p5.js. I researched that using HTML and CSS would achieve the result easier and quicker. Further improvement could be adding floating effects to text and substitute real text from Mike or other stakeholders. In addition, we may could figure out a way that embedded magnifier effect inside the virtual tour without losing significantly efficiency.

My commits can be found on my forked repository [here](https://github.com/TheOneFrank/keyboard-institute).

### Joshua
While I visited the recording studio over the summer break, I did not do much aside from [documenting events when I was there](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wglD-HT-2VdPYmTmxyTUIEJOHAtL7Pdi). The rest of the break was spent researching hosting sites and their use terms and conditions. After the break ended, I was tasked with hosting the audio and embedding it for use on a website. There was a bit of a delay obtaining the recorded audio and a couple of auto-copyright claims that had to be disputed when hosting. The audio files are hosted privately on my [soundcloud account](https://soundcloud.com/user-864940059), as well as the team’s shared Google drive. I have created a html file with some information on the soundcloud embedded format and a playlist of the recorded works for each piano, which can be found either my own [forked repository or the main audit repository](https://github.com/Joshua-Liow/keyboard-institute/blob/master/Prototype/soundcloudfiles.html).

### Seng
My role since the last audit has been director of photography. I came in for two of the studio days to photograph the pianos for the website. This involved borrowing lighting from design and multimedia in the Peter Karmel building. I also took a bit of video using the cameras in the recording studio. Finally, I post-processed all the photos and exported them to a format and size that is suitable to be hosted on the web. The exported photos can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-RmJfmfPF0zCo4mnIZ_kqQxiiD_MA2XB).

### The Next Few Weeks...
As the semester wraps up, we will be looking to prepare the project for handover in case we do not continue next semester. This will involve cleaning up the website, looking at ANU for hosting, sorting out the intellectual property rights of our content (audio/images), and giving Mike direct control over all the content.
