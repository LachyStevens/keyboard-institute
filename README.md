### Vision:
Inaugurated in 2005, the ANU School of Music's Keyboard Institute is the largest collection of freshly-built copies of historical instruments and period instruments in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the largest growing keyboard collection in Australia, and the largest public and scholarly resource of historical instruments in Australia.

The keyboard institute has their [own website](http://music.cass.anu.edu.au/services/instruments-equipment/keyboard-institute) hosted on the ANU School of Music's webpage, but are looking for a better way to promote the institute and what it has to offer. As such, we've been tasked with using technology to not only promote the institute, but allow users to interact and engage with the instruments in the collection. We aim to do this in two ways

-----

1. Create a new website for the keyboard institute.

The current website for the keyboard institute needs a bit of love. We would look to create a highly interactive, where users can experience high quality audio and video documentation of the instruments, information about the instruments (History, Description), and possibly interviews regarding the instruments.

-----

2. Investigate the possibility of using VR to allow users to more directly and immersively interact with the instruments.

We have brainstormed a couple potential ways to achieve this including recording sample libraries to allow users to "play" the instruments via MIDI instruments, 3D modelling some of the instruments and allowing users to view the features in 3D space, and creating a 3D 'tour' of the institute allowing people to move as they please. This part of the project is really a stretch goal, and will be further explored later in the course.

### Stakeholders:
An updated stakeholder 

----

### Stakeholder Expectations:
The clients have expressed that the expectation is for us to produce some sort of interactive experience promoting the instruments they have in the keyboard institute. How to do so has mostly been left in our own hands.

----

### Delivering Value:
Our main goal is to create an interactive website full of high fidelity images and sound, and information about the instruments itself. Our plan is to make use of the resources we have here at the ANU, including the recording studio, the cameras in the ANU School of Art, and the invaluable advice and assistance from the bright minds around the ANU. We will be looking to host this website on the ANU School of Music's domain if possible, and will hopefully draw more people to the institute to make use of the wide range of instruments available.

### Timeline:
|Week|Goal|
|---:|----|
|4|Ensure all planning is wrapped up and all aspects of the project are up and running.|
|8|First Deliverable: Early version of the website. This would include the general webpage structure and the instrument information.|
|10|Second Deliverable: A pre-release version of the website, possibly with some audio, video and sound.|
|12|Third Deliverable: Release the webpage.|

*Note:* This is a preliminary timeline for the project, and as such is subject to change.

----

### Constraints:
- We need to investigate whether or not we can get our website hosted on the ANU School of Music's domain, and how much we can put on the website (in terms of memory usage)

----

### Risks and Costs:
- Potential web hosting costs
- If we choose to develop with Unity later in the project, may look to host with Unity's version control system, which may possibly incur costs.

----

### Management:
**Project Repository:** You're on it! GitHub will be used to host our project code. We plan to make use of the issues system when development begins.

**Trello :** [Email Lachlan for access.](u5826298@anu.edu.au) Trello will be used to help plan our project.

**File Repository** [Email Lachlan for access.](u5826298@anu.edu.au). We are using Google Drive to host our miscellaneous  files, including meeting minutes and design documents.

_"For the last few weeks I have been working on the design of the website. I used Microsoft PowerPoint to prototype by creating slideshows that not only look like a website but also can somewhat simulate user interaction. These prototypes showed my design of the virtual tour and the website in general. 

The latest version can be found [here](https://goo.gl/cdMZSw)."_
